<p>This is a project that consists of creating a UI clone of the LinkdeIn feed that has been improved and added the feature to like the post and as they are in action, it will automatically open the comments session that the post received. The project was developed in ReactJS in conjunction with TypeScript and other tools.</p>

## 🚚 Apporaches

1. Used a responsive grid system to create a responsive layout.
2. Used media queries to make sure the layout adjusts appropriately for different screen sizes.
3. Styled the clone to match the look and feel of LinkedIn. This is involved choosing appropriate colors, fonts, and images.
4. Make sure the user interface is easy to use and navigate.
